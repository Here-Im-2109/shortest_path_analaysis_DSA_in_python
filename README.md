# Shortest Pathfinding Algorithm 🚀

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python implementation of a shortest pathfinding algorithm that navigates between given points while avoiding multiple obstacles. The algorithm ensures that the path taken is the most efficient and shortest possible.

## Features 🔍
- Implements an intelligent pathfinding algorithm
- Supports multiple obstacles in the environment
- Efficiently finds the shortest path between the given points
- Can be extended for different use cases (e.g., robotics, game AI, navigation systems)

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Python 🐍
- pygame
- math
- Pathfinding Algorithms
- PriorityQueue

## Getting Started 🚀
### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/shortest-pathfinding.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
Run the main script to visualize the pathfinding process:
```bash
find_shortest_path.py
```
Modify `updated_find_shortest_path.py` to change the grid size, obstacles, or algorithm settings.

## Example Visualization 🎨
The algorithm finds the shortest path while avoiding obstacles and displays the result graphically.

## Future Improvements 🔧
- Implement more advanced pathfinding algorithms
- Optimize performance for large grids
- Add a GUI for easier interaction
